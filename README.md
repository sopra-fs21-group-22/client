## Introduction
game bang...

## Technologies
- React: CSS, HTML, Javascript
- GitHub (Actions)
- Heroku
- Bootstrap
- REST API

## High-level Components
main components: [GameDashboard](src/components/game/GameDashboard.js), [Lobby](src/components/game/Lobby.js), [WaitingRoom](src/components/game/WaitingRoom.js)

## Launch & Deployment

For your local development environment you'll need Node.js >= 8.10. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies including React get installed with:

### `npm install`
For the external text-to-speech API to function correctly the following dependency needs to be installed as well
### `npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`

This has to be done before starting the application for the first time (only once).

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome!).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
